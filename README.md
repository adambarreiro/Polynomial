Polynomial
===========

Educational video game for the teaching of polynomials to secondary school students who are on their third year. 

What's this
-------------------------

Polynomial is my Final Project for the university in order to graduate in CS. It's a 2D educational game made with a JavaScript engine called CraftyJS, node.js for the backend and MongoDB for all the storage stuff.

The story introduces you as a soldier who is trapped in an unknown planet fullfilled with monsters which you need to defeat by resolving operations with polynomials (hence the name). Also you'll find treasures that you'll open by answering questions related to polynomials theory.
