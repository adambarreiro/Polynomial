Overview
-------------------------

Polynomial is my Final Year Project in order to graduate in Computer Science Engineering. It's a 2D educational game made with a JavaScript engine called CraftyJS, node.js for the backend and MongoDB for all the storage stuff.

The story introduces you as a soldier who is trapped in an unknown planet fullfilled with monsters which you need to defeat by resolving operations with polynomials (hence the name). Also you'll find treasures that you'll open by answering questions related to polynomials theory.

Game mechanics
-------------------------

There are some places to hide along the levels in which the player can attack the enemies without being detected. This
will trigger a battle that has to be finished resolving operations with polynomials.

If the enemy spots the player or the player fails an operation in the hidden mode, a timer will appear, which means that the player must resolve the operation before it reaches zero to not lose health.

There are also some chests with theorical questions which give some bonus:
* Health restoration
* Shield
* More power
* More time

Languages
-------------------------

The game is entirely in Spanish at the moment.

Manuals
-------------------------
